# My Public IP mac toolbar app

Basic mac toolbar app that displays and allows you to copy your current public internet IP address (v4 or v6, the later prefered).

Simply click on the toolbar to open the menu and then click on either v4 or v6 IP addresses to copy it to the clipboard.

Refreshes once every 5mins with a count down in the toolbar dropdown menu.
